Merging branches has never been easier.

# Key Features

* Stash & Patch - Uncommited changes handler while merging.
* Merge from - Merge any branch into your local branch.
* Configure options on the git merge command (more info in the repo's [wiki](https://github.com/shaharkazaz/vscode-git-merger/wiki/User-config)).

# Road Map
